# youtube_downloader

a Python app made using the Tkinter and Pytube libraries, it offers a GUI in which paste the youtube link or the playlist and to start downloading it. It was a very interesting project to make and a very useful one too! 
During the coding I stumbled across some issues, especially regarding the errors handling, but I was able to solve them!
